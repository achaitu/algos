Given an array A of length n integers, provide an O(n^2) to provide the longest inceasing subsequence of A. i.e find the length of the longest subsequence such that all the elements of the subsequence are in increasing order. 

Input:

First line: num of test cases. Next 2 lines 

First line contains num of integers n,

Second line consists n integers. 

Output:

Length of longest inceasing subsequence.
