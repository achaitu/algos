Given two strings, A and B of lenghts m and n, provide an O(m*n) DP based algorithm for the min edit distance of A and B and print their final allignments. Insertion, deletion and updation are the operations that are allowed each of unit cost. 


Constraints:

1   1 < m < 100

2   1 < n < 100

Input:

First line consists the num of test cases
Next two lines are the strings to be compared

Output:

The mim edit distance of the two strings

Sample Input 0

1
PAIN
RAINY

Sample Output 0

2
PAIN_
RAINY

Explanation 0

The minimum edit distance between PAIN and RAINY is 2.
