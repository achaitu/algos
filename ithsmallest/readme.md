Given an array of n numbers and a positive integer i, write a program to find the i th smallest element that runs in O(n) time.

You are given an array a[ ]={17,54,24,32,12,25,3,38,20} and an integer i=3.

You have to find i th i.e. 3rd shortest element from this list.

The sorted order of the above array is {3,12,17,20,24,25,32,38,54} and thus the 3rd smallest element is 17. [PDF Version]
